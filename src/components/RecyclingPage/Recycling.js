                        <li className = "answer-style"> Glass containers - When you get empty glass bottles(used in creams) back irrespective of their sizes, you can choose to take <b>Rs. 20/- off on your next purchase of any item</b></li>
                        <li className = "answer-style"> Lip balm containers:  When you get empty lip balm containers back, you can choose to take <b>10/- off on your next purchase of any item</b></li>
